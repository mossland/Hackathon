# Mossverse Hackathon

This repository introduces mini-services of Mossverse (Mossland Metaverse). Mini-services entail a service that runs within the metaverse and serves to provide various contents to the Mossverse. This repository is where anyone can suggest ideas and participate in the development.

## Project
1. [가위바위보 Rock Paper Scissors](RockPaperScissors/README.md)
  - The user selects one of rock, paper, or scissors.
  - The game proceeds and win or loss is confirmed.
  - When you win, you get a profit of 1 ~ 10 times of the multiplier.
2. [THUG War](thug_war/README.md)
  - The starting THUG character appears, and the user must guess whether the character ID is higher or lower than the starting character.
  - THUG character IDs are displayed in ascending order on the top of the screen.
