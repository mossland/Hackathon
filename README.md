# Mossverse Hackathon

This is a Hackathon Repository for developing mini-services of [Mossverse (Mossland Metaverse)](https://github.com/mossland/mossland-metaverse). Mossverse is a blockchain-based metaverse project that connects the real and virtual worlds, pursuing the realization of a hyper-connected world. Mini-services entail a service that runs within the metaverse and serves to provide various contents to the Mossverse. The hackathon is a repository for mini service development, where anyone can suggest ideas and participate in the development.
